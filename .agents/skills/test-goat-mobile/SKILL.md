# Test GOAT Mobile

## Prerequisite: Agent device access

Device tools work only while **Agent device access** is on in **Settings →
Integrations → Devices** for this environment (a project can override it).
It is a person's grant, and no agent tool can change it. Check it first:
`goat_describe {path:"device.list"}` reports `available.now: false` with a
reason that names the setting while it is off, and a `device.list` call is
refused with the same reason.

When it is off, ask the user to turn it on for the verification run, then wait
for their reply. The grant reaches the thread on its next turn; if the device
command is still missing from the shell, ask the user to restart the agent
session. When verification ends, tell the user they can turn it back off if it
was off before you asked.

## Open the device

GOAT's device tools run through `goat_call`. Call `goat_call {path:"device.list"}`, then
`goat_call {path:"device.open"}` with the selected host and device IDs.
GOAT boots the device and shows its live stream in the Device panel. Follow its
returned `quickStart`, using the exact `agentDevice.command` and all `targetArgs`
on every operation. Use `goat_call {path:"device.screenshot"}` to inspect the screen.

If GOAT device tools or the selected device are unavailable, report the blocker
and stop verification. Do not install or switch to another automation system.

## Use an isolated backend

Reuse this task's healthy backend. Otherwise run `vp run dev` from the
repository root, retain its terminal session, and read the actual backend port
from the dev-runner output. Use the worktree's ignored `.t3` state. Never run
against `~/.t3/userdata`. The Browser panel is not required for this workflow.

Test with meaningful project and thread data. Read the shared
[SQLite fixture reference](../test-goat-app/references/sqlite-fixtures.md) only
when inspecting or seeding SQLite. Stop the test server before fixture writes.

## Launch GOAT Dev

From the checkout being tested on the selected device host, run:

```bash
vp run mobile:install <ios|android> <device-id>
```

This installs the dev client for the checkout's native fingerprint: from the
device, the local cache, or the shared cache in seconds, building once only
when no machine has that fingerprint yet (5-15 minutes, logged to the file it
names). The device id may be omitted when exactly one device is booted. It
prints one JSON line; on failure it names the next command. Authorized mobile
verification includes that step unless the user prohibits it.

For a device you opened in an agent-device session elsewhere (a device pool,
cloud, or remote host), run `vp run mobile:install <ios|android> --session <s>`
from the directory you opened the session in. It installs the cached build into
that session (`--abi arm64-v8a` for an ARM Android device; `--metro <url>` also
opens it against Metro) and never builds.

Start `vp run dev:client` from `apps/mobile`, or reuse a healthy Metro belonging
to this checkout. Open its printed development-client URL with AgentDevice
`open com.t3tools.t3code.dev <url>` and all returned target arguments.
The device must be able to reach both Metro and the isolated backend.
Append `&disableAutoLaunch=1&disableFab=1` to the development-client URL query
when developer chrome would obscure screenshots or taps; the SDK 58 dev client
applies these preferences before the app loads.

## Pair and verify

Use the helper from the repository root, with the returned executable and target
arguments stored in `agent_device_command` and the Bash array
`agent_device_target_args`:

```bash
.agents/skills/test-goat-mobile/scripts/pair-client.sh \
  <server-port> <base-dir> <device-reachable-backend-origin> \
  "$agent_device_command" "${agent_device_target_args[@]}"
```

It issues a fresh credential and opens GOAT Dev's existing pairing route
through AgentDevice. For a backend on the device host, use
`http://127.0.0.1:<server-port>` on iOS or `http://10.0.2.2:<server-port>`
on Android. For a remote backend, use its reachable origin.

Confirm the intended projects appear, exercise the affected flow, and capture
evidence. Retain the app and environment while iterating. At teardown, remove
the disposable connection, close the AgentDevice session, call `goat_call {path:"device.close"}`,
and stop only your backend and Metro processes.
