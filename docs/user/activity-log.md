# Activity log

On web and desktop, consecutive tool calls appear as an expandable summary. Open it to inspect
commands, tool inputs, status, and exit codes. Expand a tool call to see its output. A running
command's output updates live, and long output shows only its most recent part. Use **Open diff** on
a file change to review its contents.

GOAT Orchestrator summaries describe the actions taken, such as **Ran 2 commands and sent messages
to 3 threads**. Repeated messages to the same destinations show both counts: **Sent 5 messages to
2 threads**. Thread creation counts the threads returned by the tool, including batches.

Groups with many kinds of activity show up to two specific action categories and a count of the
remaining actions. Commands, file changes, and orchestration changes take priority over reads and
status checks. Expand the group for the full list.

Failed calls do not count as successful messages or creations. Waiting on a thread does not mean
it finished, and an interrupt or cancellation request does not mean the thread stopped. When tool
details are unavailable, summaries use a broader description instead of guessing how many threads
were affected.

## Screen reader announcements

On web and desktop, a screen reader hears the open thread's turn as it runs. **Screen reader
announcements** in **Settings → General** sets how much. **Status only** says when a turn starts,
needs your approval or input, and ends. **Status and messages** also reads each message the agent
writes and then keeps working after, once that message is complete. A very long message is cut
short. The reply that closes the turn is not read, so you can read it yourself when you hear
**Done**. **Everything** adds the step the agent is on, such as the command it is running. Steps
are spaced out, so a quick step can be skipped for a newer one.
The agent's reasoning text is never read. The setting applies to this browser or device only.
